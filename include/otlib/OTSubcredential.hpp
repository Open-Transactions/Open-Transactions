//
// Each credential is like a master key for the Nym's identity,
// which can issue its own subkeys.
//
// Each subkey has 3 key pairs: encryption, signing, and authentication.
// Not all subcredentials are a subkey. For example, you might have a
// subcredential that uses Google Authenticator, and thus doesn't contain
// any keys, because it uses alternate methods for its own authentication.
//
// Each OTCredential contains a "master" subkey, and a list of subcredentials
// (some of them subkeys) signed by that master.
//
// The same class (subcredential/subkey) is used because there are master
// credentials and subcredentials, so we're using inheritance for "subcredential"
// and "subkey" to encapsulate the credentials, so we don't have to repeat code
// across both.
// We're using a "has-a" model here, since the OTCredential "has a" master

The contents is the public version, signed by the subkey, which contains the master-signed version inside of it as a data member (this variable in fact, m_strMasterSigned.) You might ask: then what's in m_strRawContents? Answer: the version that includes the private keys. Well at least, on the client side.

    // should call VerifyContractID, VerifyInternally, VerifyMaster, and VerifyAgainstSource. (If that last step later
    // on adds too much slowdown, then we'll modify that function to check a signed file left for us by the IDENTITY
    // VERIFICATION SREVER which we can stick in a separate process.)

    // and EACH subcredential is going to also re-verify its source (when they all share the same source!)
    // Solution?
    // Clearly the master itself only needs to be verified once, including its source, when the Nym is first loaded.
    // (Verifying it twice would be redundant.) After that, each subcredential should be verified internally and against
    // its master -- again, when first loaded. No need to verify it again after that, since it wouldn't have even loaded.
