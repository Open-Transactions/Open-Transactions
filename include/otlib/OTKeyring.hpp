    // -------------------------------------------------------

    // NOTE: Normally the "username" in our context is related to the
    // master key. OTCachedKey will call OTKeyring::RetrieveSecret, and
    // will pass in probably a hash of the encrypted master key as the
    // "username", and will retrieve the cleartext master key as the
    // "password" (which it then uses as the password for all private
    // keys in the wallet.)
    //
    // OT *already* caches its master key inside the OTCachedKey object
    // itself, for X minutes. So then, why have this additional step,
    // where we store it using whatever is the standard API for
    // "protected memory" on the user's computer? The answer is, so that
    // we can cache the password BETWEEN runs of the OT engine, and not
    // just DURING the CURRENT run. For example, only this sort of
    // caching makes it possible to set the user free from still having
    // to enter his password for every run of an OT script.
    //
    // I don't even know if I recommend using this OTKeyring, since I
    // don't necessarily trust the operating system's protected memory,
    // and since the password is vulnerable during the time it is cached
    // by the OS, since any other process ALSO running as the same user
    // is able to ask the OS what the cached value is.
    //
    // (So be careful what software you run on your computer...)
    // In fact, perhaps OT should ONLY run as a certain user, which is
    // not used for anything else. Have it be setuid. That way, even if
    // a hacker can trick you into running his trojan as your own user,
    // he will be unable to query the OS for your master key, since your
    // user is not what was used to cache the PW in the first place (a
    // special "OT user" being used instead.) And thus cannot be used to
    // retrieve it, either.
