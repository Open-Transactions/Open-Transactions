 *
 *   Extra WAIVER for OpenSSL, Lucre, and all other libraries

 *   for any other open source libraries included in this
 *   project: complete waiver from the AGPL is hereby granted to
 *   compile, link, and/or use them with Open-Transactions,
 *   according to their own terms, as long as the rest of the
 *   Open-Transactions terms remain respected, with regard to
 *   the Open-Transactions code itself.
 *
 *   Lucre License:
 *   This code is also "dual-license", meaning that Ben Lau-
 *   rie's license must also be included and respected, since
 *   the code for Lucre is also included with Open Transactions.
 *   See Open-Transactions/src/otlib/lucre/LUCRE_LICENSE.txt
 *   The Laurie requirements are light, but if there is any
 *   problem with his license, simply remove the Lucre code.
 *   Although there are no other blind token algorithms in Open
 *   Transactions (yet. credlib is coming), the other functions
 *   will continue to operate.

// Each credential is like a master key for the Nym's identity,
// which can issue its own subkeys.
//
// Each subkey has 3 key pairs: encryption, signing, and authentication.
// Not all subcredentials are a subkey. For example, you might have a
// subcredential that uses Google Authenticator, and thus doesn't contain
// any keys, because it uses alternate methods for its own authentication.
//
// Each OTCredential contains a "master" subkey, and a list of subcredentials
// (some of them subkeys) signed by that master.
//
// The same class (subcredential/subkey) is used because there are master
// credentials and subcredentials, so we're using inheritance for "subcredential"
// and "subkey" to encapsulate the credentials, so we don't have to repeat code
// across both.
// We're using a "has-a" model here, since the OTCredential "has a" master
// subkey, and also "has a" list of subcredentials, some of which are subkeys.
//
// Each subcredential must be signed by the subkey that is the master key.
// Each subkey has 3 key pairs: encryption, signing, and authentication.
//
// Each key pair has 2 OTAsymmetricKeys (public and private.)
//
// I'm thinking that the Nym should also have a key pair (for whatever is
// its current key pair, copied from its credentials.)
//
// the master should never be able to do any actions except for sign subkeys.
// the subkeys, meanwhile should only be able to do actions, and not issue
// any new keys.
