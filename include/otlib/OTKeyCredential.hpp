 *   Lucre License:

 *   See Open-Transactions/src/otlib/lucre/LUCRE_LICENSE.txt
 *   The Laurie requirements are light, but if there is any

// A nym contains a list of master credentials, via OTCredential.
// The whole purpose of a Nym is to be an identity, which can have
// master credentials.
//
// Each credential is like a master key for the Nym's identity,
// which can issue its own subkeys.
//
// Each subkey has 3 key pairs: encryption, signing, and authentication.
// Not all subcredentials are a subkey. For example, you might have a
// subcredential that uses Google Authenticator, and thus doesn't contain
// any keys, because it uses alternate methods for its own authentication.
//
// Each OTCredential contains a "master" subkey, and a list of subcredentials
// (some of them subkeys) signed by that master.
//
// The same class (subcredential/subkey) is used because there are master
// credentials and subcredentials, so we're using inheritance for "subcredential"
// and "subkey" to encapsulate the credentials, so we don't have to repeat code
// across both.
// We're using a "has-a" model here, since the OTCredential "has a" master
// subkey, and also "has a" list of subcredentials, some of which are subkeys.
//
// Each subcredential must be signed by the subkey that is the master key.
// Each subkey has 3 key pairs: encryption, signing, and authentication.
//
// Each key pair has 2 OTAsymmetricKeys (public and private.)
//
// I'm thinking that the Nym should also have a key pair (for whatever is
// its current key pair, copied from its credentials.)
//
// the master should never be able to do any actions except for sign subkeys.
// the subkeys, meanwhile should only be able to do actions, and not issue
// any new keys.

// CONTENTS needs to be PUBLIC and PRIVATE contents, EACH being a string map.
//
// The server (or anyone else) will only be able to see my public contents, not my private
// contents.
//
// The credential ID comes from a hash of the credential. (Which must be signed before it can be hashed.)
//
// Since I will have a public version of the credential, signed, for others, and I will have a private version
// signed, for myself, then I will have to store both signed versions, yes? I can't be re-signing things because
// the public version is hashed to form my credential ID. So once signed, we can't be signing it again later.
//
// So I think OTCredential will store a string containing the signed public version. Then it can include a copy
// of this string in the signed private version. (That way it always has both versions safe and signed, and it can
// always pull out its public version and send it to servers or whoever when it needs to.
//
// A subcredential can store its own signed public version, which must contain the master credential ID and be
// signed by that master key. If a subcredential is a subkey, then it must also be signed by itself.
//
// This is packaged up and attached to the signed private version, which includes the private keys, and is only
// stored on the client side.
//
// Might want also a version with IDs only.
//
// When creating a new credential, I want the ability to specify the public and private key information.
// But what if I don't specify? I should be able to pass NULL, and OT should be smart enough to generate
// the three certs and the three private keys, without me having to pass anything at all.
//
// If it's a master, this subcredential should be signed with itself.
// If it's a normal subcredential (not master) then it should be signed with
// its master, but not signed by itself since it may have no key.
// If it's a subkey (a form of subcredential) then it should be signed by itself
// AND by its master. And it must contain its master's ID.
// But if it's a master, it cannot contain its master's ID except maybe its own ID,
// but it is impossible for a contract to contain its own ID when its ID is a hash
// of the signed contract!
//
// I might make OTKeycredential and then have OTSubkey and OTMasterkey both derive from that.
// That way the master key doesn't have to contain its own ID, while the subkey can still contain
// its master's ID.
