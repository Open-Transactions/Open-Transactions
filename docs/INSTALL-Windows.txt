## Guide for OT on Windows

Note:
 You can run OT on Windows XP (sp3) or later, however you must compile
 and build OT from the latest version of windows.  (building on old versions
 of windows may work however, is not supported by da2ce7).

# BUILD

Note:
 This build guide has been tested on Windows 8.1, I believe that with few or any
 changes it may work from windows 7 sp1 and later.

 The ‘development folder’ is the root where the Open Transactions resides.
 ie: ..\ dev\Open-Transactions where ‘dev’ is the development folder.

Dependencies (installed):
1. Visual Studio 2013 (the free express for windows desktop version works just fine).

2. Git (While not compulsorily, it is strongly recommended:
     Download from here: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/

3. OpenSSL 1.0.1: Download and follow instructions for both: x64 and 86x.
    http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
    Install with default settings to the default locations.

4. Java (Optional, not recommended unless needed):
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

Dependencies (packaged):
1. Protoc (Protocol Buffers Compiler), download the latest:
    protoc-2.5.0-win32.zip: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list
    extract to ..\dev\protoc-2.5.0-win32

2. SWIG (optional for now, needed to regenerate the swig interface file).
    swigwin-2.0.11.zip: http://www.swig.org/download.html
    extract to ..\dev\swigwin-2.0.11


Dependencies (compile):

Note:
 For all the compiled dependancies we use our own Visual Studio Project Files.
 These each of these files got into the root-directory of the dependancy source
 folder.
 Our project files are contained in .z7 archives in:
      ..dev\Open-Transactions\project\_3rdparty

1. Protobuf (Google Protocol Buffers)
    protobuf-2.5.0.zip: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list
    extract to ..\dev\protobuf-2.5.0
    run: ..\vsprojects\extract_includes.bat
    move folder: ..\vsprojects\include to ..\include

<apoliakov>	 For Protobuffer I already met this problem
<apoliakov>	 Fix is here https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/issues/detail?id=531
<apoliakov>	 Just add #include <algorithm> in common.h


2. ZeroMQ (latest git 2.x version)
    using the command prompt: open up ..\dev\ folder.

$ git clone https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq2-x.git


3. ChaiScript (latest git version on 5.x branch)
    using the command prompt: open up ..\dev\ folder.

$ git clone https://github.com/ChaiScript/ChaiScript.git
$ cd ChaiScript
$ git checkout ChaiScript_5_0_CPP_11
$ git clean -fxd


Note:
 How to ‘install’ these dependancies.
 To make use of the compile dependancies you need to copy, (as they are), the following
 folders into your Open-Transactions folder.
   “include” and “lib”



## Open Transactions ##

   using the command prompt: open up ..\dev\ folder.

$ git clone https://github.com/Open-Transactions/Open-Transactions.git
$ cd Open-Transactions
$ git checkout chai5
$ git clean -fxd

   run the protobuf compiler:
$ project\makeproto.bat

   (optional) run the swig generator:
# swig\buildwrappers.bat

   open the project solution: ..\project\open-transactions.sln
   build OT.

   (optional) open the swig interface solution: ..\swig\project\otapi-wrap.sln
   build needed interfaces.


the output is in the directory:

..\lib\..


## Running OT ##

1. Running OT for the first time.

Create folders and config files on first run:

a. In Visual Studio open ‘ot Property Pages’ and select the debugging tab.

Select Configuration: All Configurations.
Select Platform: All Platforms.

Set: Command Arguments: “scripts\opentxs”
     Working Directory: “$(SolutionDir)..\”


Apply Changes, and set ’ot’ project as the startup project.

b. Press the F5 or select ‘start debugging’ to start OT.

## When you load up the first time it will not load. ##


2. Setting the script directory to your development folder:

a. In the file explorer open up you AppData/Roaming folder.
b. Navigate to the newly created ‘OpenTransactions’ folder.
c. Open the ‘ot_init.cfg’ in WordPad
d. Under [paths] change:
     scripts_is_relative = false
     scripts = Full path to:  ..\dev\Open-Transactions\scripts\ot

^^ replace with the actual full path…

3.  Now you should be fine to run OT.

To run ‘ot’ from the console, run:

$ lib\Win32\Debug\ot scripts\opentxs

If OT ever doesn’t exit cleanly you will need to delete the pid file.
 
  

## Making Windows Installers ##

1. Download and install nsis builder.
    unicode: http://code.google.com/p/unsis/downloads/list
    x64: https://bitbucket.org/dgolub/nsis64/downloads


2. To generate installer: right click on the file and select
   the correct compiler.

   Run ..\project\setup.nsi with the x86 Unicode.
   Run ..\project\setup_x64.nsi with the x64.





## Have fun!!!!!
